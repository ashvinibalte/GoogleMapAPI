<h1><b1>Title: Interactive Google Map Application</b1></h1>

<h2><b1>Overview:</b1></h2>

The Interactive Map Application is designed to enhance user interaction with geographical data using Google Maps. This Android application allows users to dynamically place markers by long-pressing locations on the map and visualize these points with connecting lines (polylines), facilitating easy tracking and visualization of routes or areas of interest. The application provides intuitive map controls, including zoom, tilt, and rotation, to enhance user experience when exploring different regions.

<h2><b1>Key Features:</b1></h2>

1. Marker Placement: Users can add markers to the map by long-pressing any location, which helps in marking specific points of interest or waypoints on routes.
2. Polyline Visualization: As users add markers, a red polyline connects these points sequentially, offering a visual representation of the path or area outlined by the user.
3. Dynamic Map Controls: The app includes comprehensive controls such as zoom, compass, rotation, tilt, and scrolling, enabling users to navigate the map easily and effectively.
4. Camera Auto-Adjustment: The map view automatically adjusts to encompass all markers placed by the user, ensuring all selected points are visible within the map's viewport.
5. Map Toolbar: A toolbar for quick access to directions and other map-specific functionalities.

<h2><b1>Technology Stack:</b1></h2>

1. Android Studio: Utilized as the integrated development environment (IDE) for developing the Android application, with Java as the primary programming language.
2. Google Maps Android API: Integrated within the app to display and interact with Google Maps.

<h2><b1>APIs and Libraries:</b1></h2>

1. Google Maps Android API: Provides the maps data and functionalities such as markers, polylines, and camera controls. This API is crucial for handling map interactions and rendering geographical data.
2. Android Support Libraries: These are used for backward compatibility and to incorporate modern Android UI components, ensuring a robust and smooth user interface.
   
<h2><b1> Project Goals:</b1></h2>
The main objective of this application is to provide an interactive platform for users to visually mark and navigate through geographical locations of interest. By leveraging the capabilities of the Google Maps Android API, the application aims to offer a rich and intuitive user experience that can be useful in various scenarios such as planning travel routes, marking event locations, or simply exploring new geographical areas.

This application combines advanced mapping functionalities with user interaction to create a dynamic and useful tool for anyone needing detailed and customizable map views.
